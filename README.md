# minishell
Reimplementation of a Unix shell from scratch

The first step toward creating a shell. This project consists in writing a mini-shell able to read to evaluate basic command lines from a user. The reading part implies trivial lexical and syntactic analyses of the command line, and the evaluation part implies to locate the requested binary on the computer and run it, or running the corresponding code in case of a built in functionality of the shell.

Objectives:
- Basic lexical and syntactic analysis ("lexing" and "parsing") 
- Running a program in a new process 
- Environnement management 
- PATH management 

Skills:
- Unix 
- Rigor 
- Imperative programming
